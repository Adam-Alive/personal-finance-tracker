# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Code Validation

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate the run.py file.

Result:
-   Pass: No Errors.

## Testing Note

Although the Code Institute CLI terminal is pre-defined, in keeping with good practice I have conducted a number of tests regarding browser compatibility, responsiveness and accessibility.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on Chrome, Edge and Safari to check for compatibility issues.

I tested each browser on the landing page and have provided summary of these tests below.

| Browser | Landing Page | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/chrome.png) | Works as expected |
| Edge | ![screenshot](documentation/edge.png) | Works as expected |
| Safari | ![screenshot](documentation/safari.png) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

I deployed the project early on and tested on three of my own devices throughout the development process:

Moto (g8) power

HP Desktop (24")

MacBook Air (13")

I also used Dev Tools to test on a tablet device.

I tested the responsiveness of the landing page and have provided a summary of these tests below.

| Device | Landing Page | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Moto(g8) mobile (own) | ![screenshot](documentation/mobile-portrait.png) | CLI template does not scale for mobile devices |
| Tablet (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/ipad.png) | CLI template does not scale for tablet devices |
| HP Desktop (own) | ![screenshot](documentation/hp-desktop.jpg) | Works as expected |
| MacBook Air (own) | ![screenshot](documentation/macbook.jpg) | Works as expected |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

Results for desktop devices:

## Bugs

-   **Issue:** To improve the user experience, I wanted to add thousand comma separators to numbers in the output. For example, an input of income 2000 would result in an output of income 2,000 and annual income 24,000.

-   I added code to apply this to income, expenditure surplus (see lines 169 - 174):

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-5-2.png)

-   But when running the program it crashed and would not display the full financial summary see:

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-5-1-surplus.png)

-   As shown, the TypeError involved the comparison of the surplus value with 0 in order to print out relevant message (disposable income, deficit or income matching expenditure) - see lines 183 - 190 in the code above.

-   This error confirmed that, since I had added a comma separator, the data was now a string, not an integer, so could not be processed mathematically.

-   **Fix:**
-   I therefore changed the code so that the comma separators were added after the surplus comparisons with 0. See new lines 181 and 183 below:

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-5-3.png)

-   The Financial Summary was now displaying correctly, with the disposable income shown:
