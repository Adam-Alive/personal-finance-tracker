# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](README.md) file.

## Code Validation

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

### Python

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

The CI Python Linter can be used two different ways.
- Copy/Paste your Python code directly into the linter.
- As an API, using the "raw" URL appended to the linter URL.
    - To find the "raw" URL, navigate to your file directly on the GitHub repo.
    - On that page, GitHub provides a button on the right called "Raw" that you can click on.
    - From that new page, copy the full URL, and paste it after the CI Python Linter URL (with a `/` separator).
    - Check the example table below for a live demo.

It's recommended to validate each file using the API URL.
This will give you a custom URL which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a file to validate it again in the future.
Use the steps above to generate your own custom URLs for each Python file.

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |

## Browser Compatibility

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing at least 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Sample browser testing documentation:

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Home | About | Contact | etc | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-about.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-contact.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/browser-chrome-etc.png) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

| Device | Home | About | Contact | etc | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsive-mobile-home.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsive-mobile-about.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsive-mobile-contact.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/responsive-mobile-etc.png) | Works as expected |

## Lighthouse Audit

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Sample Lighthouse testing documentation:

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-home-desktop.png) | Some minor warnings |
| About | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-about-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-about-desktop.png) | Some minor warnings |
| Gallery | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-gallery-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/lighthouse-gallery-desktop.png) | Slow response time due to large images |
| x | x | x | repeat for any other tested pages/sizes |

## User Story Testing

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

| User Story | Screenshot |
| --- | --- |
| As a new site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature01.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature02.png) |
| As a new site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature03.png) |
| As a returning site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature04.png) |
| As a returning site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________. | ![screenshot](documentation/feature05.png) |

| repeat for all remaining user stories | x |

## Bugs

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

- JS Uncaught ReferenceError: `foobar` is undefined/not defined

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug01.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- JS `'let'` or `'const'` or `'template literal syntax'` or `'arrow function syntax (=>)'` is available in ES6 (use `'esversion: 11'`) or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug02.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

- Python `'ModuleNotFoundError'` when trying to import module from imported package

    ![screenshot](documentation/bug03.png)

    - To fix this, I _____________________.

## Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
