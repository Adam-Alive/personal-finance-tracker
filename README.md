# [PERSONAL FINANCE TRACKER](https://aa-personal-finance-tracker-46a2e4082ae9.herokuapp.com)

## Project Purpose

This app will enable users to calculate their monthly disposable income, based upon input of their monthly income and expenditure, and also indicate their total weekly, monthly and annual expenditure.

Users can enter figures into 15 pre-defined expenditure fields and then add their own if necessary.

Output will consist of a list of all expenditure items and a financial summary showing their disposable income (or deficit) and total weekly, monthly and annual expenditure.

## Target Audience

The target audience is adults who wish review their ongoing finances, and the pre-defined expenditure fields allow for a range of lifestyles with the option of adding categories more personal to the user.

The image below shows how the app is displayed on various devices.

## UX

### Initial Design
The overall design is informed by Code Institute's command line interface (CLI) template, to be deployed on Heroku, with the terminal set to 80 columns by 24 rows.

-   **Before coding, I planned the flow of the application.**

-   **Firstly, with a flow chart using MS Word:**

![screenshot](documentation/flowchart.png)

-   **Secondly, with a more detailed written framework:**

![screenshot](documentation/framework.png)

-   **And finally, with a draft script with text to include in the code:**

### Typography

The CLI template uses Courier New.

## User Stories

As a user, I would like to see instructions about the app so that I can use it.

As a user, I would like to enter my financial data effectively.

As a user, I would like to enter my own expenditure categories. 

As a user, I would like to see a summary of my finances and disposable income.

As a user, I would like to restart the app to use again or exit.

## Features

### Existing Features

- **Expenditure Summary**
    - All the user's expenditure items and costs are listed and the total monthly expenditure shown. If entered, their own items have been capitalised in the list eg. Health insurance and Gym membership.
     - The user is then invited to press RETURN to take them to their financial summary.

![screenshot](documentation/exp-summary.png)

- **Financial Summary**
    - The user is presented with a summary of their monthly income and expenditure, and an indication of whether they have disposable income, a deficit, or spend exactly the same as they earn. 
    - There is also a summary of annual and weekly income and expenditure.
    - Shown below are the three possible outcomes for a surplus (disposable income), a deficit, or income matching expenditure.

### Future Features

- **Text Colour**
    - Use [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) to add colour to CLI text eg. red for the deficit figures and bold for other text.
- **Currency Symbols**
    - Ask user to choose currency symbols and apply these to the output using [currency-symbols](https://pypi.org/project/currency-symbols/)
- **Decimal Places**
    - Add two decimal places function to give a more precise output for the user â€“ **check with Tim about this.**

## Tools & Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org) used as the back-end programming language.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) used for version control. (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- [GitHub](https://github.com) used for secure online code storage.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) used as a cloud-based IDE for development.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) used for hosting the deployed back-end site.

## Data Model

The app uses Python to adopt an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) framework.

A dictionary of **key:value** pairs is initiated ie. `finance_dict` with 15 **keys** assigned to the pre-defined expenditure items, and their respective monetary **values** assigned according to the user input (and reset when the app restarts).

### Functions

**The primary functions used are:**

`def clear()`
-   Clears the terminal window.

`def setup_dict()`
-   Initiates dictionary for expenditure items.

`def start_app()`
-   Welcome messages and instructions.

`def get_income()`

### Imports

I've used the following Python package:
- `os`: used for adding the `clear()` function.

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser.
This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://aa-personal-finance-tracker-46a2e4082ae9.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- If using any confidential credentials, such as CREDS.JSON, then these should be pasted in the Config Variables as well.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a personal-finance-tracker` **CHECK WITH TIM (replace *app_name* with your app name)**
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If using any confidential credentials, such as `CREDS.json` or `env.py` data, these will need to be manually added to your own newly created project as well.
